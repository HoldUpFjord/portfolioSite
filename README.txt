This was my first attempt at a personal site. The main page is atempelate used from HTML5up: "https://html5up.net/hyperspace". The intent is to be a forward facing freelance web design page, with a secondary page for dev roles.

Working with a existing codebase like this allowed me to examine and play with a lot of CSS I hadn't encountered or worked with until that point. Some examples are  psuedocode such as before::/after::, dealing with inheritance and stylizations, and tinkering with the overall design and anchortags.

The second page/AboutMe section has the CSS bones of the tempelate, but with quite a few changes. I wanted to make a custom layout that also blended with the design from the first page. After gutting the generic page found in the tempelate, I arrived at a layout I liked. Using Hsl color gradients to keep cohesion of the color design led was a solution that took quite a few tries. I found a blog post from a frontend dev and a tool he used to make very interestng gradients, found here: https://www.joshwcomeau.com/gradient-generator/ , and landed upon the final design.

I also integrated bootstrap column layouts in the myTech sections as it assisted in responsiveness.
